This project was created to teach Best Practices for developing Angular applications.

## Modularization

Modularization of Angular projects using Nx Workspace.

> Modularize your project using libraries and keep your application lean.

> Delegate routes to lazy-loaded feature libraries.

> Separate lazy-loaded feature libraries from shared libraries, even if they cover the same domain.

## Components

Best practices for maintainable, reusable components.

> Keep components small.

> Keep business logic out of components.

> Keep components stateless.

> Differentiate between presentational and container components.

## State Management

Domain-driven state management using NgRx.

> Use selectors to create projections of your state.

> Let actions reflect your domain events.

> Organize your state by feature libraries, avoid global state.

> Only export those actions and selectors that need to be exposed.
